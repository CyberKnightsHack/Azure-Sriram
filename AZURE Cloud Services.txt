Introduction

-Virtualization is a process of simulating a Hardware & software resourses such as a server, storage device or network in a Virtual or software environment.
-Scalability

Types 
- Server Virtualization 
- Storage Vitualization
- Network Virtualization 

Virtualization Process

-Basically one Server can take place of the three and all the application and run their different opertating systems this is what Virualization does.
-Its basically consolidating all of these physical server with their different OS, application and running them on just one physical server in a virtual encironment.

Virtual machine

-Virtualization creates virtual hardware by cloning physical hardware.
-The hyperVisor uses virtual hardware to create a virtual machine
-A VM is a set of files.
-With a hyperVisor and VM's, one computer can run multiple OS simulataneously.

The HyperVisor

-The software that creates and run the virtualization is called Hypervisor.
-It allocates and controls the sharing of machine's resources such as
 -- Storage space
 -- RAM
 -- CPUs
-Two types of hypervisor is known as TYPE 1 hypervisor & Type 2 Hypervisor.

TYPE_1

-TYPE 1 Hypervisor installed on BARE METAL SERVER.
-That means there is no existing operating system (or) any other software on the machine.
-Used for hardware Virutualization.
-In order to create a VM with a Type 1 hypervisor 
 -- Servercase

- after build our server hardware next step is to install type 1 hypervisor on top of ours baremetal server.
- So we can create and manage VM's.
- The hypervisor will allocates the server hardware resources, installing different OS and installing different applications.
- Mainly used in Enterprise DataCenter.
- Example Software 
   -- VMWARE ESXI
   -- CITRIX XEN SERVER
   -- MICROSOFT HYPER- V

TYPE_2

-Hypervisor(type 2) installed and runs on the top of an existing operating system
-Mostly used for OS virtualization.
-Quick and easy.
-Example Software
  -- Oracle VirualBox
  -- Microsoft virtual PC
  -- VM workstation

Benefits of Virtualization
-Cost Savings
-Increased Flexibility
-Improved Management
-Enhanced Security
-Business Continutiy


DAY 2

Silver Lining in the Cloud

-How about provisioning (renting) resources when you want them and relevent them back when you do not need them ?
-On demand resource provisioning.
-Also called Elasticity.

Cloud - Advantages

-Trade "capital expense" for "variable expense".
-Benefit from massive economies of scale.
-stop guessing capacity.
-Increase speed and agility.
-Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
-"Go Global" in minutes.
			
cloud models
  -- service  -> (IaaS,PaaS,SaaS)
  -- deployment -> (public, private, Hybrid, Multi Cloud )

2008 - October Project 
2010 - Feb windows azure -> After 4 years (2014 Mar ) - Microsoft azure and launch 3 type services.

60+ Azure regions and 300+ data centers.


Service -1 [ virtual machine ]

step -1 : Search



Service -2 [ Resource Group ]

A fundamental unit for organizing and managing cloud resources.



DAY - 3

Load balance 

Distributing network traffic.  -> standard and gate way 

process

Linux -> command
search -> load balancer and create standard
  -- Type - Public 
Add a frontend -> create public Ip - enter name and save
Go to Backend -> add a backend - enter name 
review + create 

after deploy in menu go to backend pool -> add a pool

   -- click Ip address


Container Instance [ Paas ]7

To run applications without mangaging servers or virtual machines it fast light weight and easy to use.
run quickly
no management 
test and develop 
isolated environment

Storage Account 

A storage account in azure is place to store your data like files, images, videos and more in the cloud.

Types 
 - Blob
 - Files
 - Tables 
 - Queues
 - Disk

Internet IIS

IIS is a webserver developed by Microsoft for the windows OS. It is used to host, deploy, and manage website and web applications.
